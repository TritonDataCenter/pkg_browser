pkg_browser is a simple web application designed for browsing pkgsrc
packages. By default the server listens on the ip 0.0.0.0 and port 80.
You can override this by running pkg_server.js with -h host and -p port.

If you'd like to help with development, please see the github issues for
a list of what needs to be done, there's plenty to do and help is
greatly appreciated.

To create something usable run:

`dmake` or `make` or `gmake`
`DESTDIR=/some/path make install`

An smf template is provided in DESTDIR/out/smf.

The design was done by Ben Hutchison <ben@aldaviva.com>.
